## Build a calculator with Pact

This Jam is designed to help you with functions in Pact. 

In this first exercise, you are going to implement the following features:

- `add function` -> "Should add two numbers"
- `substract function` -> "Should substract two numbers"
- `multiply function` -> "Should multiply two numbers"
- `sum function` -> "Should add multiple numbers"
- `multiply function` "Should multiply multiple numbers"

***We provided a set of tests in the `.repl` file***

***You cannot modify the `.repl` file***
